# GHFollower

#### Sean Allen's [iOS Dev Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSIe2y6Fee8)

The application let you search for a GitHub username, see the followers that this username has.

Search for a specific follower. See the information about this follower (profile, folowers, bio, number of repos, gists, etc). 

The app let you save a list of usernames (so you don't have to type them every time) and see those usernames followers.
